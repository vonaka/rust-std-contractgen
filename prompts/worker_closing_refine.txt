1. Remember that your updates should be written in the same order in which the
corresponding functions appear in the original source file.

2. Do not generate duplicates: if the original code already contains `requires`
annotations or assertions that cover or imply all of your intended annotations
for a function, then omit those annotations and exclude them from your response.

3. Remember that only pointers and references can be used in `modifies`.

4. If the filename starts with "library-core" you must replace `std::` in your
annotations by `crate::`, otherwise, it should be replaced by `core::`.

Correct and print your solution without any additional explanation.
