Pay attention to the following.

Common Mistakes to Fix:
1. The annotated method uses a variable named `this`, but the contract refers to `self`. In this
   case `self` should be renamed to `this`.
2. The `modifies` attributes are either not generated or are generated with incorrect arguments.
3. A `modifies` attribute references a variable that is not a pointer or reference. This needs to be
   corrected, as `modifies` should only apply to references or pointers.
4. The name of the annotated function in the output does not exactly match the name in the original
   source file. This should be fixed.
5. Expressions like `pos < end <= self.len()` are not valid in Rust. This should be written as
   `pos < end && end <= self.len()`.
6. A field of a structure is accessed directly instead of being accessed through the structure's
   variable; i.e., using `field` instead of `self.field`.
7. A function appears in the output but is not annotated. In this case, the corresponding function
   should be removed from the output.
8. The output is missing the name of the structure for the annotated functions.
9. Contracts refere to `std::` -- this is forbidden.
10. In Rust, `a ==> b` is not a valid way to express the logical implication. This should be
    replaced by `!(a) || b`.

With that, correct your mistakes (if any) and print the complete, corrected solution without
additional explanations.
