You will now learn how to write harnesses (proofs) for the contract preconditions you've generated.
After that, you'll be asked to create harnesses (proofs) for each function that you annotated.

Step 1: Learn the Basics
Read this brief introduction to Kani's contracts:

Step 2: Deepen Your Understanding
For more details, review this blog post:

Step 3: Study Real Examples
Examine how `proof_for_contract` is implemented and used in the following Rust files:
